Included are the additions_00.tre along with 
the corresponding and other pertinent .lua files in thier folders.

The .tre file needs to be added to the .tre folder in the workspace 
and the SWGEmu installation folder clientside. 

Also, add the name of the .tre to both the client (swgemu_live.cfg or other if youve renamed it)  
(at the top of the .tre list) and adjust the search priority number. 
Then add it to the swgemu/workspace/MMOCoreORB/bin/conf.lua at the bottom of the tre list. 

The included armor folder should be added to the objects/tangible/wearables/armor 
folder in the workspace.

The included backpack folder should be added to the objects/tangible/wearables/backpack 
folder in the workspace.

The included allobjects.lua should be added to the scripts/object folder in the workspace.

Ive also included a copy of the characterbuilder.lua for easy copy & pasting.
